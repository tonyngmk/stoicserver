But plans, as the boxer Mike Tyson pointed out, last only until you\u2019re punched in the face. Stoics do not seek to have the answer for every question or a plan for every contingency. Yet they\u2019re also not worried. Why? Because they have confidence that they\u2019ll be able to adapt and change with the circumstances. Instead of looking for instruction, they cultivate skills like creativity, independence, selfconfidence, ingenuity, and the ability to problem solve. In this way, they are resilient instead of rigid.
